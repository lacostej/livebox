# This test case contains an abnormal date computation from the ADSL page
# the last connection time starts at lundi 25 avril, 17:46:06, then goes to 17:46:07 and 17:46:08
# note that the disconnection time also exhibits strange values, with lundi 25 avril, 17:44:47
#
# we should really identify all this dump as a single connection
